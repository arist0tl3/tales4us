<h2>A Shared Story App</h2>

This is a platform for shared collaboration between authors. It is in a very beta state, so please be kind! I'm doing my best to make sure that your content is backed up and available, but I strongly suggest that you make your own backups as well.

You can use the app <a href="http://tales4.us">here.</a>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

Right now, there are a lot of limitations. Authors are limited to 20/story, there is a hard-coded 60 second timer for author turns, there is no limit to how much or how little an author can type, any formatting has to be entered manually, etc. But, it works.
