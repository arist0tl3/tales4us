        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>This is a platform for shared collaboration between authors. It is in a very beta state, so please be kind!
          I'm doing my best to make sure that your content is backed up and available, but I strongly suggest that you
          make your own backups as well.</p>
        <h4>Getting Started</h4>
        <p>First, you need to login. You can do that by using the link in the upper right hand of the screen.</p>
        <p>To create a new story, simply click <a href="/create">I want to create a new story!</a> If you want to invite
          other users to join your story, simply give them the url.</p>
        <h4>Roadmap</h4>
        <p>Right now, stories are limited to 20 contributors, though any number of users can view the story as it
          progresses. Also, there is a limit of one chapter. I would like to increase the number of users, and offer the
          ability to do chapter breaks. The time limit is hard coded, and I'd like to offer more options to storie creators.
          But, this is just a roadmap!</p>
        <h4>Enjoy!</h4>
        <p>Any questions, <a href="mailto:sean@vigorwebsolutions.com">email me!</a></p>
